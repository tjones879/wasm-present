					<h2>What is WASM?</h2>
					<p>
						Web assembly serves as a new compilation target for web developers.
						This standard is being developed by major players including Apple,
						Google, Microsot, and Mozilla.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why is it useful?</h2>
					<p>
						A brief history of javascript must first be understood.
						Javascript has historically been powerful enough for most of our needs in the web.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, large file sizes and poor performance in comparison to native languages
						create significant problems within
						<a href="http://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/"> certain contexts. </a>
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h4>Alternatives</h4>
					<p>
						Using Emscripten, you can already compile many source languages (Haskell, etc.) into relatively
						fast JS.
					</p>
					<p>
						Developers needed more power, so a special subset of JS called asm.js was declared.
						This allows for javascript to be executed much closer to native speeds. (2x difference)
					</p>

					<h2>Who uses it, and is it stable?</h2>
					<p>
						Currently, web assembly is not yet used. There are multiple issues
						preventing widespread adoption, namely:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The standard is still rapidly changing.</li>
						<li>Browser compatibility is lacking.</li>
						<li>Source languages are few.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

					<h2>What is a working example?</h2>
					<p>
					We must first enable our browser to run wasm. 
					You must be running at least Firefox 52 or Chrome 57 and enable special flags,
					just as with WebGL.
					</p>
					<p>Example in Chrome:
					</br>
					<a href="">chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly</a>
